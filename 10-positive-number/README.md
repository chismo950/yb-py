* np.arange(1, 11) returns an integer array that starts at 1 and ends at 11 but does not include 11, so it returns [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10].
* arr.shape returns the shape of the NumPy array. (10,) means the array has 10 elements and is one-dimensional.
* arr.dtype returns the data type of the array's elements. int64 means a 64‑bit integer, which occupies 64 bits of memory and can store values from −2^63 to 2^63−1.
* arr * 2 doubles all elements in the array.
